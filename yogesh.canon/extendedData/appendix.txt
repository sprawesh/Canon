Temporal Analysis

Body type? Photo detector dummy ?
digital zoom need to be addressed.
Increasing trend for max_res1 and max_res2
More number of other resoulation with time, but with jump like function.
Earlier Image Ratio 4:03 then 3:02 or 16:09. Newer cameras have 2 or more image-ratio options.
Increasing trend for effective pixels.
Sensor photo detector is NA for many new models, but exhibits increasing trend
Sensor size follows random pattern, sensor type no useful information.
Newer cameras have Digic4 processor.
ISO_old with differing range. However, ISO_new exhibits increasing trend.
white balance presets may be useful to determine generations and frequency has increased over time.
Digital zoom is mostly 4x, 
Artculated LCD appears in later period.
optical zoom increases for the subsequent model.
decreasing trend for weight and size.
storage type and processor can be valuable.
